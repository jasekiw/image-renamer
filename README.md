# ImageRenamer

This program automatically renames images in incrementing order and prefixes the name with just enough 0's to cover the amount of photos in the folder.

This program renames a folder of pictures. It is invoked with two arguments: `<path-to-directory> <ByName|ByDateTaken>`.

Your photos must have the date taken attribute that adobe lightroom adds if you sort by date taken.
